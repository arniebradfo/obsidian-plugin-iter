# Inline AI Chat Notebook

An interactive LLM chat interface built directly into your Obsidian Markdown files. This plugin allows you to treat your notes as a collaborative workspace with AI, where every "turn" of the conversation is fully editable.

## Features
- **Inline Chat**: Conversations happen directly in the editor using ` ```turn ` blocks.
- **Multi-Modal**: Support for local and remote images via standard Markdown links.
- **Provider Agnostic**: Use Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or Azure OpenAI.
- **Flexible History**: Edit AI responses or your own prompts at any time to steer the conversation.
- **Model Suggestions**: Autocomplete support for model selection in every block.

## How to use
1. Install the plugin and configure your API keys in settings.
2. Open a note and run the command **"New AI Chat Notebook"** (or click the plus icon in the ribbon).
3. Type your prompt and hit **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** or click **Submit to AI**.
